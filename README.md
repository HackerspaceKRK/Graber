Graber i3 3D Printer
=================

This is a clone of the Graber i3 3D printer - fully laser cuttable redesign of Josef Prusa's Prusa i3.

The overall build envelope dimensions remain the same as the Prusa i3, which is
200mm x 200mm x 200mm.

A bill of materials is forthcoming. That said, it is really pretty straight-forward
once you have the laser cut frame put together. I have added some basic labeling
to each part to make assembly easier and here is the part rundown:

* Bottom (A) - 1
* Left Brace (B) - 1
* Right Brace (C) - 1
* Front (D) - 1
* Back (E) - 1
* Frame (F) - 1
* Z-Motor Mount Bottom (G) - 2
* Z-Motor Mount Bottom Brace (H) - 2
* Z-Top (I) - 2
* Z-Smooth Rod Constraint (J) - 2
* Y-Motor Mount (K) - 1
* Y-Idler (L) - 2
* Y-Carriage (M) - 1
* X-Carriage (N) - 2
* Y-Smooth Rod Stop (O) - 4
* Y-Belt Holder (P) - 2
* X-axis smooth rod spacer (Q) - 4
* X-Idler Front (R) - 1
* X-Idler Middle (S) - 1
* X-Idler Back (T) - 1
* X-Idler Top / Bottom (U) - 2
* X-Idler Cap (V) - 1
* X-Motor Front (W) - 1
* X-Motor Middle (X)- 1
* X-Motor Back (Y) - 1
* X-Motor Top / Bottom (Z) - 2
* X-Motor Cap (AA) - 1
